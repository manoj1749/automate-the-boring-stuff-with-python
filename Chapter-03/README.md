## Solutions for practice questions in Chapter-3
1. To reduce the duplicating the code, we use functions. Whenever we decide to change the code, then we need to change the each and every code, instead of it defining functions makes it easier.
2. The code in a function runs when it is called.
3. The 'def' statement creates a function.
4. A function is what we define using 'def' statement and contains the code which needs to be executed. And a function call is when a fucntion defined is called and it gets executed.
5. There is only one global scope, whereas one local function will be assigned for a founction when it is called.
6. When a function returns, the all variables stored in it gets forgotten as the scope containing these varibales gets destroyed.
7. When a founction is called and it gets executed there will be result or evaluation of final value, which can be called as return value. And the return value can be part of a expression.
8. When the function does not have a return statement, the return value will be None.
9. We can a force a function in local scope to be a global variable by using global statement.
10. The data type of None can be said aas NoneType.
11. The statement import areallyourpetsnamederic imports a python library or module called as areallyourpetsnamederic.
12. After importing a module called spam, we call the function bacon() in spam using the statement spam.bacon().
13. We can prevent a program from crashing when it's getting a error by keeping the line or block of code which causes the error in try clause.
14. The code-block or the line of code which causes an error goes into the try clause, And when the try clause causes an error the execution moves to the code in except clause.
