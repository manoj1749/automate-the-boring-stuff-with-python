## Solutions for practice questions in Chapter-3
1. To reduce the duplicating the code, we use functions. Whenever we decide to change the code, then we need to change the each and every code, instead of it defining functions makes it easier.
2. The code in a function runs when it is called.
3. The 'def' statement creates a function.
4. A function is what we define using 'def' statement and contains the code which needs to be executed. And a function call is when a fucntion defined is called and it gets executed.
5. There is only one global scope, whereas one local function will be assigned for a founction when it is called.
6. When a function returns, the all variables stored in it gets forgotten as the scope containing these varibales gets destroyed.
7. When a founction is called and it gets executed there will be result or evaluation of final value, which can be called as return value. And the return value can be part of a expression.
8. When the function does not have a return statement, the return value will be None.
